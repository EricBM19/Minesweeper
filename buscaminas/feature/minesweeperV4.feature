Background:
Given a user opens the app

@done
Scenario Outline: Default Counter, must show the amount of hidden mines in the board
Then the counter should show the following value: "10"

@done

Then the timer should show the following value: ""

@done
Scenario: Default Status, alive
Then the status should be: "üòê"

@manual
Scenario: Default cells status, clear and untagged
Then all cells should not display any information

Then the amount of rows should be: 8
And the amount of columns should be: 8

@manual
Scenario: Activating the Timer
When the user reveals the box "1-1"
Then the Timer value should start counting

Scenario: When the user thinks there is a mined box, then tags the box as mined
When the user marks the box "1-1" as mined
Then the box "1-1" should display a mined symbol

Scenario: When the user thinks there can be a mine in one box, then tags the box as uncertain
When the user marks the box "1-1" as uncertain
Then the box "1-1" should display a uncertain symbol

Scenario: Untagging a box with a mined symbol
Given the user tags as mined: "1-1"
When the user tags again "1-1"
Then the tags should be: "uncertain symbol"

Scenario: Untagging a box with an uncertain symbol
Given the user has an uncertain tag over the box: "1-1"
When the user tags again "1-1"
Then the tags should be: ""

Scenario Outline: Tagging/Untagging a box with the mouse (right click)
Given the user tags as "<current-tag>" the box "1-1"
When the user right clicks on cell "1-1"
Then the box "1-1" should be "<new-tag>"

Examples:
| current-tag | new-tag |
| no-tag      | mined    |
| mined       | uncertain|
| uncertain   | no-tag   |

Scenario: Changing the Counter value by adding a mined tag
Given the Counter shows a "<current-value>"
When the user tags a box at "<Row-Column>" as mined
Then the "<Counter value>" should change 

Example:
| current-value |  Row-Column  | Counter Value |
|       10      |     1-1      |       9       |
|        5      |     2-6      |       4       |

Scenario: Revealing a tagged box must be allowed
Given the user tags the box at "1-1" as mined
When the user revals the box "1-1"
Then the box "1-1" should reveal its content

Scenario Outline: When the user reveals a mined box, the game ends with a game over
Given the user reveal the box at "<Row-Column>"
When the box reveals a mine box
Then the game should end

Example:
|  Row-Column  |
|     1-3      |
|     2-1      |
|     2-7      |
|     3-2      |

When the user reveal the box at "1-3"
Then all boxes marked tagged as uncertain should be displayed

Scenario Outline: Revealing a box with bombs near and without a mine
When the user reveal the box at "<Row-Column>"
Then the box should display a "<Number>"

Example:

|  Row-Column  |  Number  |
|     1-1      |    1     |
|     1-2      |    2     |
